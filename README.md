# Minimal Linux Set up
A clean and minimal desktop environment:
- i3 window manager
- polybar for status bar
- xcompmgr for lightweight transparency
- neovim with custom theme
- Catppuccin color scheme across all components
- Wallpaper [interstellar_black_hole](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImageGoNord/comments/1f1if0s/3840_2160_interstellar_black_hole/)

> Note: This setup is running inside a VirtualBox VM. xcompmgr was used instead of picom due to GLX support issues in the virtualized environment.
